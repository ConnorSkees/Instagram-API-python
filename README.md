# Instagram-API-python

#### Unofficial Instagram API that gives easy access to common functions

This is a Python port of the [PHP version](https://github.com/mgp25/Instagram-API)
It is still a work in progress to copy all of its API endpoints.

NOTE: To successfully parse for a long time you should verify your phone number in your Instagram account. 
The new fake Instagram account with an unverified phone number after ~ 1-24 hours could not do any requests. All requests will be redirected to the page https://instagram.com/challenge
